- 👋 Hi, I’m @FiniteLo0p
- 👀 I’m interested in strengthening and polishing my development skills.
- 🌱 I’m going to be taking a data structures class during the upcoming fall (2022) at university and the last two semesters focused on programming in Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will have me and help me grow.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out if you would like some assistance or have any questions.
